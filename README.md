## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
-[leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)-JS library for implementing maps


### What I learned

I learned how to implement api in the project using async and await and other react features and also i learned how to add map to a application. 
### Continued development

I will learn REDUX tool kit so that state managemnt can become easy and less messy and i will continue including an env file in my project to secure my api key.
